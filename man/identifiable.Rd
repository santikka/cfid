\title{Identify a Counterfactual Query}
\usage{
identifiable(g, gamma, delta = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{A \code{DAG} object describing the causal graph
(to obtain a \code{DAG} from another format, see \link{import_graph}.}

\item{gamma}{A \code{counterfactual_conjunction} object
representing the counterfactual causal query.}

\item{delta}{A \code{counterfactual_conjunction} object
representing the conditioning conjunction (optional).}
}
\value{
A list containing one or more of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{id} A logical value that is \code{TRUE} if the query is identifiable and
\code{FALSE} otherwise. Note that in cases where \code{gamma} is itself
inconsistent, the query will be identifiable, but with probability 0.
\item \code{prob} An object of class \code{probability} giving the formula of the query in
LaTeX syntax via format or print, if identifiable.
This expression is given in terms of \eqn{P_*},
the set of all interventional distributions over \code{g}. For tautological
statements, the resulting probability is 1, and for inconsistent
statements, the resulting probability is 0. For formatting options,
see \link{format.probability}.
\item \code{undefined} A logical value that is \code{TRUE} if
a conditional conjunction \eqn{p(\gamma|\delta)} is undefined,
for example when \eqn{p(\delta) = 0}, and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
}
\description{
Determine the identifiability of a (conditional) counterfactual conjunction.
}
\details{
To identify a non-conditional conjunction \eqn{p(\gamma)}, the argument
\code{delta} should be \code{NULL}.

To identify a conditional conjunction \eqn{p(\gamma|\delta)}, both \code{gamma}
and \code{delta} should be specified.

First, a parallel worlds graph is constructed based on the query. In a
parallel worlds graph, for each \eqn{do}-action that appears in \eqn{gamma}
(and \eqn{delta}) a copy of the original graph is created with the new
observational variables attaining their post-interventional values
but sharing the latent variables.
This graph is known as a parallel worlds graph.
From the parallel worlds graph, a counterfactual graph
is derived such that each variable is unique, which might not be the case
in a parallel worlds graph.

Finally, the ID* (or IDC*) algorithm is applied to determine identifiability
of the query. Similar to the ID and IDC algorithms for causal effects,
these algorithms exploit the so called c-component factorization to split
the query into smaller subproblems, which are then solved recursively.
