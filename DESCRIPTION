Description: Facilitates the identification of counterfactual queries in 
    structural causal models via the ID* and IDC* algorithms 
    by Shpitser, I. and Pearl, J. (2008) 
    <http://jmlr.org/papers/v9/shpitser08a.html>. Provides a simple interface
    for defining causal graphs and counterfactual conjunctions. Construction
    of parallel worlds graphs and counterfactual graphs is done automatically
    based on the counterfactual query and the causal graph.
